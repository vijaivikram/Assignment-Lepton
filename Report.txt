For this assignment, i have selected lifestyle stores website.
I have used BeautifulSoup library to scrape the data from the website.
I have scraped all the required details and have inserted them into 
a dataframe and the converted them into a CSV file as mentioned. 
The assignmentwas easier as I had experience with BeautifulSoup 
and the only difficulty I faced was to choose my favourite store.
